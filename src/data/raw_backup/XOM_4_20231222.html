<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:9pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Dear Stockholders of Pioneer Natural Resources Company: </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:9pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On October&nbsp;10, 2023, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (&#147;Pioneer&#148;), Exxon Mobil Corporation (&#147;ExxonMobil&#148;) and SPQR,
LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of ExxonMobil (&#147;Merger Sub&#148;), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;), under which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will
merge with and into Pioneer, with Pioneer surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of ExxonMobil (the &#147;Merger&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:9pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the Merger is
completed, Pioneer stockholders will receive, in exchange for each share of Pioneer common stock, par value $0.01 per share, held immediately prior to the Merger, 2.3234 shares of ExxonMobil common stock, without par value (such consideration, the
&#147;Merger Consideration&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:9pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pioneer&#146;s board of directors (the &#147;Pioneer board&#148;) has unanimously approved the Merger
Agreement and recommends that Pioneer stockholders vote in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:9pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on ExxonMobil&#146;s closing stock
price on [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;], 2023, the most recent practicable date for which such information was available, the Merger Consideration represented approximately
$[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in implied value per share of Pioneer common stock, which represents a premium of approximately [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]% over the closing price of
the Pioneer common stock on October&nbsp;5, 2023, the last trading day prior to media reports that Pioneer and ExxonMobil were in merger discussions. The value of the Merger Consideration to be received in exchange for each share of Pioneer common
stock will fluctuate with the market value of ExxonMobil common stock until the Merger is complete. The Pioneer common stock is listed on The New York Stock Exchange (the &#147;NYSE&#148;) under the symbol &#147;PXD&#148;. The ExxonMobil common
stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol &#147;XOM&#148;. </P>  <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:9pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The Merger cannot be completed without adoption of the Merger
Agreement by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Pioneer common stock entitled to vote thereon.</B> Because of this, Pioneer is holding a special meeting of its stockholders on
[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] (the &#147;Special Meeting&#148;) to vote on the proposal necessary to complete the Merger. Information about the Special Meeting, the Merger, the
Merger Agreement and the other business to be considered by stockholders at the Special Meeting is contained in this proxy statement/prospectus. The Pioneer board has fixed the close of business on
[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;], 2023 as the record date for the determination of Pioneer stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Special Meeting. We urge you to read
this proxy statement/prospectus and the annexes and documents incorporated by reference carefully.&nbsp;<B>You should also carefully consider the risks that are described in the &#147;<A HREF="#rom558467_28">Risk Factors</A>&#148; section beginning
on page&nbsp;30.</B> </P>  <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:9pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The Pioneer board has unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of Pioneer and its stockholders, approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, in accordance with
the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#147;DGCL&#148;) and directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the Pioneer stockholders for adoption at a meeting of such stockholders. The Pioneer board unanimously recommends
that Pioneer stockholders vote &#147;FOR&#148; the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and &#147;FOR&#148; the proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Pioneer&#146;s named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise related to the Merger. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:9pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Your vote is very important regardless of the number of
shares of Pioneer common stock that you own. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:9pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting virtually, please submit your
proxy as soon as possible by following the instructions on the accompanying proxy card to make sure that your shares are represented at the meeting. If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, please follow the
instructions on the voting instruction form furnished by the broker, bank or other nominee. You must provide voting instructions by filling out the voting instruction form in order for your shares to be voted. </B></P>

common stock in the Merger? </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>A: </B>At the effective time of the Merger (the &#147;effective time&#148;), each share of Pioneer common stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (including the unvested restricted stock of Pioneer, but excluding shares of Pioneer common stock held (1)&nbsp;in treasury (excluding Pioneer common stock subject to or issuable in connection
with a Pioneer employee benefit plan) or (2)&nbsp;by ExxonMobil or Merger Sub, which are to be cancelled at the effective time (collectively, the &#147;excluded shares&#148;)) will be converted into the right to receive 2.3234 shares of ExxonMobil
common stock (the &#147;share consideration&#148;). No fractional shares of ExxonMobil common stock will be delivered to any holder of shares of Pioneer common stock upon completion of the Merger. Instead, all fractional shares of ExxonMobil common
stock that a holder of shares of Pioneer common stock would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger will be aggregated and, if a fractional share results from such aggregation, such holder will be entitled to receive the cash
proceeds from the sale of such fractional share by the exchange agent for the account of such holder (together with the share consideration, the &#147;Merger Consideration&#148;), without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes, in
accordance with the Merger Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Although the number of shares of ExxonMobil common stock that Pioneer stockholders will receive
in the Merger is fixed, the market value of the Merger Consideration will fluctuate with the market price of ExxonMobil common stock and will not be known at the time that holders of Pioneer common stock vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. </B>Based
on the closing price of ExxonMobil&#146;s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (&#147;NYSE&#148;) on October&nbsp;5, 2023, the last trading day prior to media reports that Pioneer and ExxonMobil were in merger discussions, the 2.3234 exchange
ratio represented approximately $253.23 in implied value for each share of Pioneer common stock. Based on ExxonMobil&#146;s closing price on [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;], 2023 of
$[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;], the 2.3234 exchange ratio represented approximately $[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in implied value for each share of Pioneer common stock. <B>The market price of ExxonMobil
common stock when Pioneer stockholders receive those shares after the Merger is completed could be greater than, less than or the same as the market price of shares of ExxonMobil common stock on the date of this proxy statement/prospectus or at the
time of the Special Meeting.</B> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Q: If I am a holder of Pioneer common stock, how will I receive the Merger Consideration to which I am entitled?

receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement) a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of certificates representing shares of Pioneer common stock (&#147;Certificates&#148;) and book-entry

directors and executive officers had the right to vote approximately [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] shares of the then-outstanding Pioneer common stock, collectively representing approximately
[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]% of the Pioneer common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on that date. We currently expect that Pioneer&#146;s directors and executive officers will vote their shares &#147;<B><I>FOR</I></B>&#148; the Merger Agreement

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>A: </B>Yes. It is a condition to the consummation of the Merger that the shares of ExxonMobil common stock to be issued to Pioneer stockholders in
connection with the Merger be authorized for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Q: How will ExxonMobil shareholders be
affected by the Merger? </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>A: </B>Upon completion of the Merger, each ExxonMobil shareholder will hold the same number of shares of ExxonMobil stock
that such shareholder held immediately prior to completion of the Merger. As a result of the Merger, ExxonMobil shareholders will own shares in a larger consolidated company with more assets. However, because ExxonMobil will be issuing additional
shares of ExxonMobil common stock to Pioneer stockholders in exchange for their shares of Pioneer common stock in connection with the Merger, each outstanding share of ExxonMobil common stock, as of immediately prior to the Merger, will represent a
smaller percentage of the aggregate number of shares of ExxonMobil common stock outstanding after the Merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Q: What are the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Merger to holders of Pioneer common stock? </B></P>  <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>A: </B>The Merger is intended to qualify as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within
the meaning of Section&nbsp;368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), and ExxonMobil and Pioneer intend to report the Merger consistent with such qualification. Each of ExxonMobil and Pioneer has agreed in the
Merger Agreement to use its best efforts (i)&nbsp;to cause the Merger to qualify as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;368(a) of the Code and (ii)&nbsp;not to, and not to permit or cause any of its respective
subsidiaries or affiliates to, take or cause to be taken, or fail to take or cause to be taken any action, which action, failure or cessation, could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to or cease to qualify as a
&#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;368(a) of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Exxon has received from Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell LLP (&#147;Davis Polk&#148;), legal counsel to ExxonMobil, and Pioneer has
received from Gibson, Dunn, &amp; Crutcher LLP (&#147;Gibson Dunn&#148;), legal counsel to Pioneer, an opinion to the effect that the Merger will qualify as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. These
opinions of counsel are based on customary assumptions and representations, covenants and undertakings of ExxonMobil, Pioneer and Merger Sub. If any of the assumptions, representations, covenants or undertakings is incorrect, incomplete, inaccurate,
or otherwise is violated, the validity of the opinions may be affected and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger could differ materially from those described in this proxy statement/prospectus. The receipt of a tax opinion from
counsel is not a condition to either party&#146;s obligation to complete the Merger. ExxonMobil and Pioneer have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the &#147;IRS&#148;) regarding the
qualification of the Merger as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. As a result, there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with the opinions or would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a
position contrary to the treatment of the Merger as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Assuming that the Merger qualifies as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;368(a) of the
Code, U.S. holders (as defined in &#147;U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger&#148;) generally will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except with respect to cash proceeds from the sale of fractional shares
of ExxonMobil common stock. If the Merger does not qualify </P>

as a &#147;reorganization,&#148; the Merger generally would be a taxable transaction to U.S. holders, and each U.S. holder generally would recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the

by applicable law, waived). These conditions include, among others, the adoption of the Merger Agreement by holders of a majority of Pioneer common stock and the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, or any extension thereof,
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the &#147;HSR Act&#148;) (in the case of ExxonMobil&#146;s obligation to complete the Merger, without the imposition of a Burdensome Condition (see &#147;The Merger

other reason, Pioneer&#146;s stockholders will not receive any consideration for shares of Pioneer stock they own. Instead, Pioneer will remain an independent public company, Pioneer common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and

 <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the Merger is completed, Pioneer stockholders will be entitled to receive, in exchange for each share of Pioneer common stock that they
own immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (except for shares that are held by Pioneer as treasury stock (other than those issuable in connection with Pioneer&#146;s employee benefit plans) or held by ExxonMobil or Merger Sub, which
will be cancelled without consideration), 2.3234 shares of ExxonMobil common stock, and cash proceeds from the sale of any fractional shares as described below. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">No fractional shares of ExxonMobil stock will be delivered to any holder of shares of Pioneer stock upon completion of the Merger. Instead,
all fractional shares of ExxonMobil stock that a holder of shares of Pioneer stock would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger will be aggregated and, if a fractional share results from such aggregation, such holder will be
entitled to receive proceeds from the sale of such fractional share. No interest will be paid or accrued on cash proceeds from the sale of fractional shares of ExxonMobil common stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Example: If you own 110 shares of Pioneer common stock at the time the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive 255 shares of
ExxonMobil common stock. In addition, you will be entitled to receive the cash proceeds from the sale of 0.574 of a share of ExxonMobil common stock by the exchange agent. </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The ratio of 2.3234 shares of ExxonMobil common stock for each share of Pioneer common stock (the &#147;exchange ratio&#148;) is fixed, which
means that it will not change between now and the date of the Merger, regardless of whether the market price of shares of either ExxonMobil common stock or Pioneer common stock changes. Based on the closing price of a share of ExxonMobil common
stock on the NYSE of $108.99 on October&nbsp;5, 2023, the last trading day prior to media reports that Pioneer and ExxonMobil were in merger discussions, the Merger Consideration represented approximately $253.23 in implied value for each share of
Pioneer common stock. Based on the closing price of a share of ExxonMobil common stock on the NYSE of $[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] on
[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;], 2023, the most recent practicable trading day prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the Merger Consideration represented
approximately $[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in implied value for each share of Pioneer common stock. <B>Because ExxonMobil will issue a fixed number of shares of ExxonMobil common
stock in exchange for each share of Pioneer common stock, the value of the Merger Consideration that Pioneer stockholders will receive in the Merger will depend on the market price of ExxonMobil common stock at the time the Merger is completed. The
market price of ExxonMobil common stock when Pioneer stockholders receive those</B> <B>shares after the Merger is completed could be greater than, less than or the same as the market price of shares of ExxonMobil common stock on the date of this

equity awards are granted to certain Pioneer employees as permitted under the Merger Agreement, ExxonMobil may be required to reserve additional shares of ExxonMobil common stock for issuance (see &#147;The Merger Agreement&#151;Treatment and

Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the &#147;DOJ&#148;). A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-day</FONT> waiting period following the
parties&#146; filings of their respective HSR notifications or the termination of that waiting period. If the DOJ or FTC issues a Request for Additional Information and Documentary Material (a &#147;second request&#148;) prior to the expiration of
this initial <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-day</FONT> waiting period, the transaction cannot close until the parties observe a second waiting period, which is 30 days by statute, but that can be extended through agreement and would begin to

4, 2023, ExxonMobil and Pioneer each received a second request from the FTC in connection with the FTC&#146;s review of the Merger. The effect of the second request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the HSR Act until 30 days after each of
ExxonMobil and Pioneer has substantially complied with the second request issued to it, unless that period is extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated sooner by the FTC. ExxonMobil and Pioneer continue to work constructively with the FTC in

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Merger is intended to qualify as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;368(a) of the Code, and ExxonMobil and
Pioneer intend to report the Merger consistent with such qualification. Each of ExxonMobil and Pioneer has agreed in the Merger Agreement to use its best efforts (i)&nbsp;to cause the Merger to qualify as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the
meaning of Section&nbsp;368(a) of the Code and (ii)&nbsp;not to, and not to permit or cause any of its respective subsidiaries or affiliates to, take or cause to be taken, or fail to take or cause to be taken any action, which action, failure or
cessation, could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to or cease to qualify as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;368(a) of the Code. Exxon has received from Davis Polk, and Pioneer has received from
Gibson Dunn, an opinion to the effect that the Merger will qualify as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. These opinions of counsel are based on customary assumptions and representations, covenants and
undertakings of ExxonMobil, Pioneer and Merger Sub. If any of the assumptions, representations, covenants or undertakings is incorrect, incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise is violated, the validity of the opinions may be affected and the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the Merger could differ materially from those described in this proxy statement/prospectus. The receipt of a tax opinion from counsel is not a condition to either party&#146;s obligation to complete the Merger.
ExxonMobil and Pioneer have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS regarding the qualification of the Merger as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. As a result, there can be no
assurance that the IRS will agree with the opinions or would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to the treatment of the Merger as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Assuming
that the Merger qualifies as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;368(a) of the Code, U.S. holders (as defined in &#147;U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger&#148;) generally will not recognize gain or loss
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except with respect to cash proceeds received from the sale of fractional shares of ExxonMobil common stock. If the Merger does not qualify as a &#147;reorganization,&#148; the Merger generally would be a
taxable transaction to U.S. holders, and each U.S. holder generally would recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i)&nbsp;the sum of the fair market value of the ExxonMobil common stock it receives in the Merger
plus the amount of any cash proceeds received from the sale of fractional shares of ExxonMobil common stock and (ii)&nbsp;such holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in its shares of Pioneer common stock exchanged in the Merger. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The U.S. federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to all holders of Pioneer common stock. You should read &#147;U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger&#148; beginning on page&nbsp;106 of this proxy statement/prospectus for a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. Tax matters can be complicated and the tax

become ExxonMobil shareholders due to differences between the laws of the states of incorporation and the governing documents of Pioneer and ExxonMobil. These differences are described in detail in &#147;Comparison of Stockholder Rights&#148;

</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since the public announcement of the Merger, two putative stockholder lawsuits related to the Merger have been filed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December 22, 2023, two complaints have been filed by purported Pioneer stockholders in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York against Pioneer and the members of the Pioneer board. The lawsuits are captioned <I>Schwarz v. Pioneer Natural Resources Company et al.</I>, Docket No.
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">1:23-cv-10915</FONT></FONT> and <I>McCall v. Pioneer Natural Resources Company et al.</I>, Docket No. 1:23-cv-10936 (collectively, the &#147;lawsuits&#148;). The lawsuits allege,
among other things, that the registration statement on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">S-4</FONT> of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part fails to disclose certain allegedly material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and
20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 under the Exchange Act. The lawsuits seek injunctive relief enjoining the Merger, damages and costs, and other remedies. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pioneer has also received letters from additional purported Pioneer stockholders who contend that the registration statement on Form S-4 of
which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part fails to disclose certain allegedly material information and demands that Pioneer make supplemental disclosures. Pioneer has also received a letter from a purported Pioneer stockholder seeking
access to certain books and records of Pioneer pursuant to Section 220 of the DGCL in connection with the Merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While Pioneer believes
that the contentions made in each of the lawsuits and letters described above are without merit, each of these matters is at a preliminary stage and defendants have not yet answered or otherwise responded to the complaints or letters. It is possible
that additional, similar complaints may be filed, and that additional, similar letters may be received by Pioneer, regarding the Merger. Absent new or different allegations that are material or constitute a disclosure obligation under the U.S.
federal securities laws, Pioneer will not necessarily disclose such additional complaints or letters. Litigation is inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance regarding the likelihood that Pioneer&#146;s defense of the lawsuits (or any
other lawsuits related to the Merger that may be filed in the future) will be successful, nor can Pioneer predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve the lawsuits. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For additional information, see the section entitled &#147;The Merger&#151;Litigation Relating to the Merger.&#148; </P>

addressed in &#147;Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements&#148; beginning on page 40 of this proxy statement/prospectus, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in determining whether to vote for the adoption of
the Merger Agreement. You should also read and consider the risk factors associated with each of the businesses of ExxonMobil and Pioneer because these risk factors may affect the operations and financial results of the combined company. These risk
factors may be found under Part I, Item 1A, &#147;Risk Factors&#148; in each of ExxonMobil&#146;s and Pioneer&#146;s Annual Reports on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K</FONT> for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2022 filed with the SEC on

exchange ratio is fixed and the market price of ExxonMobil common stock has fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate, Pioneer stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the consideration they will receive in the Merger, if completed. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the Merger is completed, each share of Pioneer common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger (except for the excluded shares)
will automatically be converted into the right to receive 2.3234 shares of ExxonMobil common stock, with any cash proceeds from the sale of fractional shares. Because the exchange ratio is fixed, the value of the Merger Consideration will depend on
the market price of ExxonMobil common stock at the time the Merger is completed. Prior to the completion of the Merger, the market price of ExxonMobil common stock is also expected to impact the market price of the Pioneer common stock. The value of
the Merger Consideration has fluctuated since the date of the announcement of the Merger Agreement and will continue to fluctuate from the date of this proxy statement/prospectus to the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is
completed and thereafter. The closing price per share of Pioneer common stock as of October&nbsp;5, 2023, the last trading day prior to media reports that Pioneer and ExxonMobil were in merger discussions, was $214.96, and the closing price per
share has fluctuated as high as $[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] and as low as $[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]

price per share of ExxonMobil common stock as of October&nbsp;5, 2023, the last trading day prior to media reports that Pioneer and ExxonMobil were in merger discussions, was $108.99, and the closing price per share has fluctuated as high as
$[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] and as low as $[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] between October&nbsp;5, 2023 and
[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;], 2023, the most recent practicable trading day prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. Accordingly, at the time of the Special Meeting,
Pioneer stockholders will not know or be able to determine the market value of the Merger Consideration they would receive upon completion of the Merger. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general
market and economic conditions, changes in ExxonMobil&#146;s and Pioneer&#146;s respective businesses, operations and prospects, market assessments of the likelihood that the Merger will be completed, the timing of the Merger, regulatory
considerations and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19.</FONT> Many of these factors are beyond ExxonMobil&#146;s and Pioneer&#146;s control. You are urged to obtain current market quotations for each of ExxonMobil&#146;s and Pioneer&#146;s

covenants and undertakings of ExxonMobil, Pioneer and Merger Sub. If any of the assumptions, representations, covenants or undertakings is incorrect, incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise is violated, the validity of the opinions may be affected and
the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger could differ materially from those described in this proxy statement/prospectus. It is not a condition to Pioneer&#146;s or ExxonMobil&#146;s obligation to complete the Merger that the Merger be
treated as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or that ExxonMobil or Pioneer receive an opinion from counsel to that effect. ExxonMobil and Pioneer have not sought, and will not seek any ruling from the IRS

common stock generally would recognize taxable gain or loss upon the exchange of Pioneer common stock for ExxonMobil common stock pursuant to the Merger. See &#147;U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger&#148; beginning on page 106 of

adoption of the Merger Agreement by Pioneer stockholders, the Pioneer board is permitted to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to ExxonMobil the recommendation of the Pioneer board in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement in certain
circumstances if it determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would reasonably likely be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Pioneer stockholders under applicable law. The Merger Agreement does not require that Pioneer
submit the adoption of the Merger Agreement to a vote of Pioneer stockholders if the Pioneer board terminates the Merger Agreement in order to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to a competing transaction in accordance with
the terms of the Merger Agreement. In certain circumstances, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, Pioneer will be required to pay a termination fee of $1.815&nbsp;billion to ExxonMobil, including if Pioneer terminates the Merger Agreement prior
to obtaining Pioneer stockholder approval in order to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to a competing transaction in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. See &#147;The Merger Agreement&#151;Termination of
the Merger Agreement&#148; and &#147;The Merger Agreement&#151;Exclusive Remedy&#148; beginning on pages&nbsp;103 and 104, respectively, of this proxy statement/prospectus. </P>

statements often address future business and financial events, conditions, expectations, plans or ambitions, and often contain words such as &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;plan,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148;

their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as statements about the consummation of the Merger and the anticipated benefits thereof. All such forward-looking statements are based upon current plans, estimates,
expectations and ambitions that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond the control of ExxonMobil and Pioneer, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking
statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: the completion of the Merger on anticipated terms and timing, or at all, including obtaining regulatory approvals that may be required on
anticipated terms and Pioneer stockholder approval; anticipated tax treatment, unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future
prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of the combined company&#146;s operations and other conditions to the completion of the Merger, including the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits of
the Merger will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the ability of ExxonMobil and Pioneer to integrate the business successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies and value creation; potential litigation

ExxonMobil and Pioneer&#146;s ability to access short- and long-term debt markets on a timely and affordable basis; legislative, regulatory and economic developments, including regulatory actions targeting public companies in the oil and gas
industry and changes in local, national, or international laws, regulations, and policies affecting ExxonMobil and Pioneer including with respect to the environment; potential business uncertainty, including the outcome of commercial negotiations
and changes to existing business relationships during the pendency of the Merger that could affect ExxonMobil&#146;s and/or Pioneer&#146;s financial performance and operating results; certain restrictions during the pendency of the Merger that may
impact Pioneer&#146;s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions or otherwise operate its business; acts of terrorism or outbreak of war, hostilities, civil unrest, attacks against ExxonMobil or Pioneer, and other
political or security disturbances; dilution caused by ExxonMobil&#146;s issuance of additional shares of its common stock in connection with the Merger; the possibility that the transaction may be more expensive to complete than anticipated,
including as a result of unexpected factors or events; changes in policy and consumer support for emission-reduction products and technology; the impacts of pandemics or other public health crises, including the effects of government responses on
people and economies; global or regional changes in the supply and demand for oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, and feedstocks and other market or economic conditions that impact demand, prices and differentials, including reservoir performance;

needed to advance ExxonMobil&#146;s 2030 and 2035 greenhouse gas emission-reductions plans are incorporated into its medium-term business plans, which are updated annually. The reference case for planning beyond 2030 is based on ExxonMobil&#146;s
Energy Outlook research and publication. The Energy Outlook is reflective of the existing global policy environment, the Energy Outlook does not attempt to project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for
the world, or ExxonMobil, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Energy Outlook, and ExxonMobil&#146;s business plans will be updated accordingly. Actual future results,
including the achievement of net zero in ExxonMobil&#146;s Upstream Permian Basin unconventional operated assets by 2030/2035 and plans to lower methane emissions from operated assets, to increase water recycling in ExxonMobil&#146;s combined
Permian operations, and to feed hydrogen, ammonia, and carbon capture projects could vary depending on the ability to execute operational objectives on a timely and successful basis; policy support for emission-reduction products and technologies;
changes in laws, regulations and international treaties regarding lower emission technologies and projects; government incentives; unforeseen technical or operational difficulties; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments,
including the ability to scale projects, technologies, and markets on a commercially competitive basis; changes in supply and demand and other market factors affecting future prices of oil, gas, and petrochemical products; the actions of
competitors; and other factors discussed in this proxy statement/prospectus and in the additional forward looking statement disclaimers included above. </P>

long-term strategic plans and goals, overall industry trends and Pioneer&#146;s operations, future growth opportunities, competitive position and risks in light of current business and economic conditions. As part of such ongoing reviews and
evaluations, the Pioneer board and Pioneer senior management regularly discuss likely key drivers of stockholder value creation and positive stock price performance for Pioneer. The Pioneer board noted in these discussions that investors have
increasingly favored companies with large market capitalizations that have the ability to maintain strong balance sheets across commodity price cycles, generate free cash flow and return capital to stockholders, either in the form of dividends or
share repurchases. In addition, in connection with such ongoing reviews and evaluations, Pioneer senior management engages in discussions with representatives of other exploration and production companies from time to time, and the Pioneer board
meets periodically in the ordinary course of business to receive updates from Pioneer senior management on such discussions and to consider and evaluate potential strategic alternatives available to Pioneer, including merger and acquisition
transactions. Such discussions and strategic alternatives have included discussions with other publicly traded and private exploration and production companies with respect to acquisition transactions by Pioneer or other business combination
transactions. Over the past several years, however, Pioneer has not executed, and has not been requested to execute, any confidentiality or similar agreement or exchanged confidential information with

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In recent months, as part of evaluating potential strategic alternatives, Pioneer engaged in discussions with Company A, an upstream company
with operations in the Permian basin, regarding the acquisition of Company A by Pioneer. Pioneer and Company A had preliminary discussions with respect to the proposed ownership percentage of Company A&#146;s shareholders in Pioneer, the potential
long-term strategy of the combined company and certain structuring, employee and governance matters. No agreement was reached on the ownership split or any other terms of a potential transaction. After considering the status of the discussions, the
possible terms that could ultimately be negotiated with Company A, the uncertainty of reaching agreement and potential investor reaction, and taking into account the considerations generally described under &#147;&#151;Recommendation of the Pioneer
Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,&#148; Pioneer concluded that the transaction with ExxonMobil would be more advantageous to its shareholders than remaining independent and pursuing the acquisition of Company A. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At various times, each of ExxonMobil&#146;s and Pioneer&#146;s general review and evaluation of the potential business combination landscape
included an assessment of the other&#146;s businesses and operations. In addition, ExxonMobil and Pioneer are generally familiar with each other, and the companies and their respective representatives have, from time to time over the past several
years, engaged in preliminary discussions about potential synergies and the benefits of a strategic transaction between the two companies. No proposals containing economic terms with respect to any such transaction were exchanged in such
discussions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On May&nbsp;25, 2023, the Pioneer board held its regularly scheduled quarterly meeting. At that meeting, as part of
Pioneer&#146;s consideration and evaluation of potential strategic alternatives, representatives of Gibson, Dunn&nbsp;&amp; Crutcher LLP (&#147;Gibson Dunn&#148;), outside counsel to Pioneer, presented materials with respect to the fiduciary duties
of the members of the Pioneer board under Delaware law, including in connection with merger and acquisition transactions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">By early June
2023, ExxonMobil believed that it was continuing to demonstrate a growing advantage in recovering resource and the efficiency of its development approach, and therefore the value it could bring to a potential transaction. ExxonMobil also believed
that the relative movements in the respective stock prices of ExxonMobil and Pioneer might make a potential transaction attainable. Darren W. Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ExxonMobil, therefore arranged a call with Scott D.
Sheffield, Chief Executive Officer of Pioneer, and, on June&nbsp;22, 2023, Messrs. Sheffield and Woods discussed the potential transaction. During the discussion, Mr.&nbsp;Sheffield conveyed the expectation that any potential acquisition of Pioneer
would need to be at a significant premium consistent with premiums historically paid in transactions of comparable size. Mr.&nbsp;Sheffield also expressed his belief that commodity prices would continue to increase, and that Pioneer had upside in
the Midland basin, which increased Pioneer&#146;s value. Mr.&nbsp;Woods expressed his view that any potential transaction would result in synergies supporting some level of premium and that ExxonMobil would likely offer <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">all-stock</FONT> consideration in any such transaction. Mr.&nbsp;Woods stated his belief that an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">all-stock</FONT> transaction would benefit Pioneer stockholders given his view that a
diversified company, like ExxonMobil, would outperform an upstream only company with geographically concentrated assets over the long-term. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;28, 2023, the Pioneer board met with members of Pioneer senior management. At the meeting, the Pioneer board discussed, among
other things, updates regarding a potential transaction with ExxonMobil. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On August&nbsp;21, 2023, as part of its regularly scheduled
quarterly meetings, the Pioneer board met with members of Pioneer senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Pioneer&#146;s financial advisor, and Gibson Dunn. A representative of Goldman Sachs led a discussion with the Pioneer board,
based on public information, regarding merger and acquisition opportunities and analysts&#146; research perspectives on possible transactions, including with respect to a potential transaction with ExxonMobil, as well as ExxonMobil&#146;s recent
management commentary regarding its views on potential acquisition activity.<SUP STYLE="font-size:75%; vertical-align:top"> </SUP></P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On September&nbsp;6, 2023, Messrs. Sheffield and Woods met to further discuss a potential
transaction. During the meeting, they discussed the importance of Pioneer employee retention to a successful outcome of the combination, considerations with respect to the location of Pioneer&#146;s headquarters following the closing of the
potential transaction and the synergy opportunities available to the combined company given the shared expertise of Pioneer&#146;s and ExxonMobil&#146;s employees. Mr.&nbsp;Sheffield expressed his continued belief that, for the Pioneer board to
consider and approve a potential transaction, ExxonMobil would need to offer a meaningful premium over the then-current trading price of Pioneer common stock, noting that he personally would support a transaction reflecting a premium of at least 20%
above the &#147;at the market&#148; exchange ratio of 2.14 shares of ExxonMobil common stock for each share of Pioneer common stock implied by the closing prices as of September&nbsp;5, 2023, but that the Pioneer board had not approved or authorized
Mr.&nbsp;Sheffield to discuss any specific premium or range of premiums and he did not know whether the Pioneer board would support a transaction at that premium. Messrs. Sheffield and Woods also discussed Pioneer representation on the ExxonMobil
board, the ability of Pioneer to pay dividends between signing and closing and ExxonMobil&#146;s payment of a termination fee in the event antitrust approvals were not obtained. As part of the discussion, Mr.&nbsp;Woods noted that while the
ExxonMobil board had yet to authorize a formal proposal to acquire Pioneer, the ExxonMobil board had extensively discussed, and remained interested in pursuing, the potential transaction and that the parties would remain in contact to further
discuss key terms. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On September&nbsp;7, 2023, the Pioneer board met with members of Pioneer senior management and a representative of

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On September&nbsp;19, 2023, Messrs. Sheffield and Woods discussed the potential transaction. Mr.&nbsp;Woods informed Mr.&nbsp;Sheffield that
the ExxonMobil board, including its Finance Committee, had authorized him to make a formal proposal to acquire Pioneer. Mr.&nbsp;Woods then previewed the terms of the proposal, which Mr.&nbsp;Sheffield said he would discuss with the Pioneer board.
Following the meeting, ExxonMobil sent a proposal letter on September&nbsp;19, 2023 (which was dated September&nbsp;18, 2023), reflecting the terms discussed between Messrs. Woods and Sheffield. The letter proposed an
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">all-stock</FONT> merger in which each share of Pioneer common stock would be valued at $255, resulting in an exchange ratio of 2.185 shares of ExxonMobil common stock for each share of Pioneer common stock, based on
a closing price of $116.70 per share of ExxonMobil common stock on September&nbsp;15, 2023, reflecting a 9.0% premium over the trading price of Pioneer common stock on the same day. The letter also stated that ExxonMobil would consider one board
seat on the ExxonMobil board for a representative of the Pioneer board and provided Pioneer with the ability to return up to 75% of free cash flow to stockholders prior to closing in the form of the current quarterly base dividend (with no further
quarterly variable dividends being paid) and share repurchases. The letter recognized that the Pioneer employee base is highly skilled and has been critical to Pioneer&#146;s success and that ExxonMobil would seek to retain most of Pioneer&#146;s
employees. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On September&nbsp;22, 2023, the Pioneer board met with members of Pioneer senior management and representatives of Gibson
Dunn, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley&nbsp;&amp; Co. LLC (&#147;Morgan Stanley&#148;), a financial advisor to Pioneer. Morgan Stanley was retained as an additional advisor to Pioneer based on its extensive industry expertise and knowledge of
Pioneer, and not by reason of any conflict of interest relating to Goldman Sachs. At the meeting, the Pioneer board discussed the September&nbsp;18 proposal letter and related matters. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley separately
discussed presentation materials provided to the Pioneer board with respect to the proposed transaction. In executive session, a representative of Gibson Dunn reviewed the fiduciary duties of the members of the Pioneer board with respect to their
evaluation of the proposed transaction. Following discussion, the Pioneer board unanimously rejected ExxonMobil&#146;s proposal in the September&nbsp;18 letter, but authorized Mr.&nbsp;Sheffield to meet with Mr.&nbsp;Woods to continue discussing a
potential transaction. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On September&nbsp;24, 2023, Messrs. Sheffield and Woods met to discuss the potential transaction. At the meeting,

proposed Merger and to Goldman Sachs, Pioneer&#146;s financial advisor, as approved by Pioneer for its use and reliance in connection with its financial analyses and opinion (see the section described above in this proxy statement/prospectus

respects, subjective judgment, and thus is susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. Pioneer can give no assurance that the Pioneer management forecast and the underlying
estimates and assumptions will be realized. In addition, since the Pioneer management forecast covers multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. This information constitutes

to reflect circumstances existing since its preparation or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error, including with respect to the accounting

of any business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the Merger Agreement having been executed, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions that would likely have been taken if the Merger
Agreement had not been executed, but which were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the Merger. Further, the Pioneer management forecast does not take into account the effect on Pioneer of any possible failure of
the Merger to occur. None of Pioneer or its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made, makes or is authorized in the future to make any representation to any Pioneer stockholder or other person regarding
Pioneer&#146;s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the Pioneer management forecast or to the effect that the forecasted results will be achieved. The inclusion of the Pioneer management forecast herein should not be deemed

entered into capped call transactions with respect to the Convertible Notes (collectively, the &#147;Capped Call Transactions&#148;) with Goldman Sachs and other counterparties (collectively, the &#147;Capped Call Counterparties&#148;), each acting
as principal for its own account, consisting of the purchase by Pioneer of capped call options with respect to collectively approximately 12,047,710 shares of Pioneer common stock, the aggregate number of shares of Pioneer common stock underlying
the Convertible Notes (with 25% purchased from Goldman Sachs). The Capped Call Transactions initially had a strike price of $109.7719 per share of Pioneer common stock, which is equal to the conversion price of the Convertible Notes based on the
initial conversion rate of 9.1098 shares of Pioneer common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of the Convertible Notes, subject to an initial cap price of $156.2140 per share of Pioneer common stock. As of November&nbsp;13, 2023, Capped Call
Transactions with respect to 544,900 shares of Pioneer common stock remain outstanding, with an adjusted strike price of $93.1281&nbsp;per share of Pioneer common stock and an adjusted cap price of $132.5285&nbsp;per share of Pioneer common stock.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Capped Call Transactions were intended to offset a portion of the potential dilutive effect on holders of Pioneer common stock of the
conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or any potential cash payment in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes that Pioneer may make in connection with a cash settlement of the Convertible Notes, in each case, up to the cap price.
The Capped Call Transactions, upon exercise thereof, generally require the Capped Call Counterparties to deliver to Pioneer a number of shares of Pioneer common stock (and/or in certain circumstances, at Pioneer&#146;s election, cash) determined
based on the excess, if any, of the lower of the cap price and the price per share of Pioneer common stock at that time (determined over a period specified in the Capped Call Transactions) over the strike price per share of Pioneer common stock.

certain events, including the announcement or consummation of the Merger, which could result in a payment from Goldman Sachs to Pioneer. In particular, under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, Goldman Sachs and the other Capped Call
Counterparties, each acting separately as the calculation agent under the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party, is entitled in certain circumstances to make adjustments to the terms of such Capped Call Transactions that reflect the
economic effect of the announcement of the Merger on the embedded call options. In addition, each of Goldman Sachs and the other Capped Call Counterparties may, acting separately as the calculation agent, determining party or otherwise as principal
under the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party, determine such adjustments in respect of such Capped Call Transactions in accordance with their terms, including on or following consummation or abandonment of the Merger. All actions or

1:23-cv-10936 (collectively, the &#147;lawsuits&#148;). The lawsuits allege, among other things, that the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part fails to disclose certain allegedly material
information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 under the Exchange Act. The lawsuits seek injunctive relief enjoining the Merger, damages and costs, and other remedies. </P>

which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part fails to disclose certain allegedly material information and demands that Pioneer make supplemental disclosures. Pioneer has also received a letter from a purported Pioneer stockholder seeking
access to certain books and records of Pioneer pursuant to Section 220 of the DGCL in connection with the Merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While Pioneer believes
that the contentions made in each of the lawsuits and letters described above are without merit, each of these matters is at a preliminary stage and defendants have not yet answered or otherwise responded to the complaints or letters. It is possible
that additional, similar complaints may be filed, and that additional, similar letters may be received by Pioneer, regarding the Merger. Absent new or different allegations that are material or constitute a disclosure obligation under the U.S.
federal securities laws, Pioneer will not necessarily disclose such additional complaints or letters. Litigation is inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance regarding the likelihood that Pioneer&#146;s defense of the lawsuits (or any
other lawsuits related to the Merger that may be filed in the future) will be successful, nor can Pioneer predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve the lawsuits. <B> </B></P>

Pioneer intend to report the Merger consistent with such qualification. Each of ExxonMobil and Pioneer has agreed in the Merger Agreement to use its best efforts (i)&nbsp;to cause the Merger to qualify as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the
meaning of Section&nbsp;368(a) of the Code and (ii)&nbsp;not to, and not to permit or cause any of its respective subsidiaries or affiliates to, take or cause to be taken, or fail to take or cause to be taken, any action, which action, failure or
cessation, could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to or cease to qualify as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;368(a) of the Code. Exxon has received from Davis&nbsp;Polk, and Pioneer has received from
Gibson Dunn, an opinion to the effect that the Merger will qualify as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. These opinions of counsel are based on customary assumptions and representations, covenants and
undertakings of ExxonMobil, Pioneer and Merger Sub. If any of the assumptions, representations, covenants or undertakings is incorrect, incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise is violated, the validity of the opinions may be affected and the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the Merger could differ materially from those described in this proxy statement/prospectus. The receipt of a tax opinion from counsel is not a condition to either party&#146;s obligation to complete the Merger.
ExxonMobil and Pioneer have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS regarding the qualification of the Merger as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. As a result, there can be no
assurance that the IRS will agree with the opinions or would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to the treatment of the Merger as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;368(a) of the Code.

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At a meeting held on October&nbsp;10, 2023, the Pioneer board unanimously (i)&nbsp;determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of Pioneer and its stockholders, (ii)&nbsp;approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger, in accordance with the requirements of the DGCL and (iii)&nbsp;resolved to recommend adoption of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of Pioneer. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Pioneer board accordingly unanimously recommends that Pioneer stockholders vote <B>&#147;FOR&#148; </B>the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, as disclosed in this proxy statement/prospectus, particularly the related narrative disclosures in &#147;The Merger&#148; and &#147;The Merger Agreement&#148; beginning on pages&nbsp;50 and&nbsp;80, respectively, of this proxy
statement/prospectus, and the copy of the Merger Agreement attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus. </P>  <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Merger cannot
be completed without the affirmative vote, at the Special Meeting (via the Pioneer meeting website) or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Pioneer common stock on the Pioneer record date and entitled to vote thereon. The
required vote is based on the number of outstanding shares&#151;not the number of shares actually voted. The failure of any Pioneer stockholder to submit a vote (i.e., by not submitting a proxy and not voting at the Special Meeting) and any
abstention from voting by a Pioneer stockholder will have the same effect as a vote &#147;<B><I>AGAINST</I></B>&#148; the Merger Agreement Proposal. Because the Merger Agreement Proposal is <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-routine,</FONT>

board has the authority, without shareholder approval, to create one or more classes or series within a class of preferred stock, to issue shares of preferred stock in such class or series up to the maximum number of shares of the relevant class or
series of preferred stock authorized, and to determine the preferences, rights, privileges and restrictions of any such class or series, including the dividend rights, voting rights, the rights and terms of redemption, the rights and terms of
conversion, liquidation preferences, the number of shares constituting any such class or series and the designation of such class or series. Acting under this authority, the ExxonMobil board could create and issue a class or series of preferred
stock with rights, privileges or restrictions, and adopt a shareholder rights plan, having the effect of discriminating against an existing or prospective holder of securities as a result of such shareholder beneficially owning or commencing a
tender offer for a substantial amount of ExxonMobil common stock. One of the effects of authorized but unissued and unreserved shares of capital stock may be to render more difficult or discourage an attempt by a potential acquirer to obtain control
of ExxonMobil by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, and thereby protect the continuity of ExxonMobil&#146;s management. The issuance of such shares of capital stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a
change in control of ExxonMobil without any further action by the shareholders of ExxonMobil. ExxonMobil has no present intention to adopt a shareholder rights plan, but could do so without shareholder approval at any future time. </P>

connection with the Merger and become stockholders of ExxonMobil. The following is a summary of certain differences between (i)&nbsp;the current rights of Pioneer stockholders under Delaware law, the Pioneer certificate of incorporation and the
Pioneer bylaws and (ii)&nbsp;the current rights of ExxonMobil shareholders under New Jersey law, the ExxonMobil restated certificate of incorporation and the ExxonMobil <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">by-laws.</FONT> </P>

governing instruments differ with respect to shareholder rights, the following discussion summarizes certain material differences between them. The following summary is not a complete statement of the rights of stockholders of the two companies or a
complete description of the specific provisions referred to below. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the DGCL, New Jersey law and Pioneer&#146;s and ExxonMobil&#146;s governing documents (which we urge you to read carefully
and in their entirety). Copies of the respective companies&#146; governing documents have been filed with the SEC. To find out where copies of these documents can be obtained, see &#147;Where You Can Find More Information&#148; beginning on
page&nbsp;146 of this proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, the identification of some of the differences in the rights of ExxonMobil and Pioneer stockholders is not intended to indicate that other differences that are equally important do not
exist. ExxonMobil and Pioneer urge you to carefully read this entire proxy statement/prospectus, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and New Jersey law and the other documents to which ExxonMobil and Pioneer refer in this proxy statement/prospectus
for a more complete understanding of the differences between the rights of an ExxonMobil shareholder and the rights of a Pioneer stockholder. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Between the date of the Merger Agreement and the effective time of the Merger, Pioneer has agreed not to amend its governing documents and

Accordingly, the rights of ExxonMobil shareholders are governed by applicable New Jersey law and Pioneer stockholders are governed by the DGCL and other applicable Delaware law. As a result of the Merger, Pioneer stockholders will receive shares of
ExxonMobil common stock and will become ExxonMobil shareholders. Thus, following the Merger, the rights of Pioneer stockholders who become ExxonMobil shareholders in connection with the Merger will be governed by applicable New Jersey law and will
also then be governed by the ExxonMobil restated certificate of incorporation and the ExxonMobil <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">by-laws.</FONT> </P>

corporation absorbed by the corporation in a consolidation or merger and any person who is or was a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of any other enterprise, serving as such at the request of the corporation or the legal representative
of any such director, officer, trustee, employee or agent) against his or her expenses and liabilities in connection with any proceeding involving such corporate agent by reason of his or her being or having been a corporate agent, other than
derivative proceedings, if (i)&nbsp;he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and (ii)&nbsp;with respect to any criminal proceeding, such person had
no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. Under <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Section&nbsp;14A:3-5(3)</FONT> of the New Jersey Business Corporation Act, a New Jersey corporation may indemnify a corporate agent against
his or her expenses in connection with any derivative proceedings. A standard of care similar to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Section&nbsp;14A:3-5(2)</FONT> of the New Jersey Business Corporation Act is applicable, except no indemnification may
be provided in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which the corporate agent is adjudged to be liable to the corporation, unless (and only to the extent that) the Superior Court of the State of New Jersey (or the court in which the
proceeding was brought) determines upon application that the corporate agent is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court deems proper. </P>

required by the previous sentence, under <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Section&nbsp;14A:3-5(11)</FONT> of the New Jersey Business Corporation Act, no indemnification may be made or expenses advanced, and none may be ordered by a court, if such
