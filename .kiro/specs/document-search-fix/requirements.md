# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SEC filing analysis system is currently returning 0 relevant documents for all user queries, preventing users from getting answers about financial data, risk factors, R&D spending, executive compensation, and other critical business insights. This feature will fix the document search and retrieval pipeline to ensure users can successfully query and analyze SEC filing data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want to search for specific information in SEC filings, so that I can get relevant document chunks that contain the information I'm looking for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a query THEN the system SHALL return at least one relevant document chunk if matching content exists in the database
2. WHEN the vector database contains document chunks THEN the search function SHALL properly calculate similarity scores between the query and stored documents
3. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN they SHALL be properly normalized and stored with the correct dimensions
4. IF the sentence-transformers library is not available THEN the system SHALL use a functional TF-IDF fallback that produces meaningful similarity scores

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the vector database to be properly initialized with document embeddings, so that search queries can find relevant content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are processed and chunked THEN they SHALL be stored in the vector database with valid embeddings
2. WHEN the TF-IDF fallback system is used THEN it SHALL be properly fitted on the full document corpus before generating individual embeddings
3. WHEN embeddings are stored THEN they SHALL not be zero vectors or invalid arrays
4. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL verify that the vector database contains valid, searchable embeddings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want to query different types of financial information (working capital, R&D spending, risk factors, etc.), so that I can get accurate and relevant answers from the SEC filings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks about financial metrics THEN the system SHALL retrieve documents containing relevant financial data
2. WHEN a user asks about risk factors THEN the system SHALL find and return risk-related sections from filings
3. WHEN a user asks comparative questions THEN the system SHALL retrieve documents from multiple companies for comparison
4. WHEN a user asks temporal questions THEN the system SHALL retrieve documents from appropriate time periods

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive meaningful error messages and system status information, so that I can understand why queries might not be working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the vector database is empty THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message indicating no documents are available
2. WHEN embeddings fail to generate THEN the system SHALL log the specific error and attempt fallback methods
3. WHEN search returns no results THEN the system SHALL distinguish between "no matching content" and "system malfunction"
4. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL display the current status of the document database and embedding system

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the embedding system to be robust and handle edge cases, so that the search functionality works reliably across different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating embeddings for a single query THEN the system SHALL use the same embedding model/method that was used for stored documents
2. WHEN the TF-IDF system is used THEN it SHALL handle single documents, multiple documents, and edge cases without throwing errors
3. WHEN embeddings are compared THEN the similarity calculation SHALL produce meaningful scores between 0 and 1
4. WHEN the system encounters malformed or empty text THEN it SHALL handle these cases gracefully without crashing
